
## Unit Testing:

- Unit testing is a white-box testing methodology that focuses on a single feacture or module of a product and on the internal code structure 
and verifies its validity and correctness. Unit tests are performed early on in the development of the application and after few code blocks 
have beeen developed, the functionality against the requirement is checked and every bugs and errors are removed.

- Unit tests are performed seperately on every functions present in the application like a single line of code, functions, methods, objects etc.

-  Unit testing has further sub-types which are, **White-box Testing** and **Gorilla Testing**.
