
### Accessibility Testing:

It is the type of software testing method that is designed to cater to the needs of the physical disabilities of a person or someone with special needs. 
These tests are carried out on software products that are designed specially for the physically handicapped. Disabilites like a hearing impairment, blindness
color blindness, paralysis etc. Some example of products that are designed for such purpose are,

-A Speech reader software device for the visually impaired/Blind that lets them type and easily interact with a computer system and ma. Whatever 
location on the screen the mouse pointer will be at, the software will read it out loud so as to let the user know where he is holding the cursor. Like if the cursor
is at an address space bar in search engine, the software will inform the user as such.

-A special purpose keyboard for persons with motor functions limitations. 

-A speech recognition software.

-A screen magnificiton software.


These are some examples as to what products are there in the market to fulfill the needs of the disabled. Now lets look at the way how some of these products can be tested.

- Check to make sure there are user documentations and user guides along with the software products.
- Check whether there are keyboard equivalents for the mouse and pointer functions..
- For any audio or video files there should be text or subtitles for those with hearing problems.
- Check to make sure that those with colour blindness have the option of using different colour themes and that no information should be conveyed via colour coding.
- Check if there is a proper response time mentioned on the screen or page so the user knows how long to wait.
- Check whether the sub-texts are written correctly in the application.


### Why is accessibility testing important?

Accessibility testing makes sure that that the right product reaches to a very untapped and large market of special persons whose requirements can be fulfilled by these 
products and applications.
