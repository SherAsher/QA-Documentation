## What is acceptance testing?

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a type of software testing that involves the end-users or clients in the process of validation and testing of a software product or application. It is the final
stage in the testing process after Unit testing, integration testing and system testing.
 


## Criteria for performing acceptance testing:

- Analyze the business requirements
- Unit tests, integration and system test should be performed before UAT
- It is made sure that there are no defects and bugs after performing System Testing
- Only Cosmetic errors, spellig mistakes or Layout/User Interface inconsistencies can be overlooked for UAT
- Business objectives should be clear.


## How to perform acceptance testing:

There are basically two stages in peforming the UAT, 

- First is the **Alpha Test**. In this stage, the test is performed by a team of an organization, whom the product is being sold to. The system under test is tested with a production like
environment and data setup. The team will execute a variety of method to check whether both the functional and non-functional features of the product are meeting their criteria and fulfiling
their business objectives.

- The second stage is the **Beta Test** in which UAT is performed rather, experimented with a few select common end-users. Beta test is performed in order to make sure that there are no major or
minor defects or failure in the product when introduced in the real-environment. The result of successfully performing UAT is the beta version the product which for the initial period is only 
limited to specific
